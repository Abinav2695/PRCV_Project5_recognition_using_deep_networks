# Project done by Abinav Anantharaman and Satwik Shridhar Bhandiwad
# CS 5330 Spring 2023 --> Recognition Using Deep Networks @ NEU

## Operating System and IDE:

I have used Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS OS and Visual Studio Code 1.74.2 for this project. 
The IDE doesn't really matters because I have compiled and built the workspace using cmake and make terminal commands

### Running Executables
* To run application  
```bash
python3 digit_dataset_train.py
python3 task2.py
python3 task3.py
python3 task4.py
```
